GCPtr (GTK+ Centre Pointer)

GTK+ tool to centre the pointer on monitor. Useful as keyboard-shortcut
on multi-head environments.

The pointer is centered on the primary monitor of the default screen. If
no primary monitor is configured by the user, defaulting to the first
monitor.

The manpage explains the usage of GCPtr and the options.

However. Maybe one day this functionality will be implemented into GNOME
directly. Until then, we have this tool ;-)
